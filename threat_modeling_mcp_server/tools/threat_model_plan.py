# Comprehensive Threat Modeling Plan

## Introduction

This is a practical, step-by-step threat modeling plan that provides specific tool guidance for conducting a thorough security analysis. Each phase includes concrete actions using the available MCP tools, ensuring systematic and comprehensive threat modeling.

## Focused Phase Guidance

Use `manage_workflow(action="guidance", phase=PHASE)` for detailed, focused guidance:

- **Phase 1**: `phase="1"` - Business Context Analysis
- **Phase 2**: `phase="2"` - Architecture Analysis
- **Phase 3**: `phase="3"` - Threat Actor Analysis
- **Phase 4**: `phase="4"` - Trust Boundary Analysis
- **Phase 5**: `phase="5"` - Asset Flow Analysis
- **Phase 6**: `phase="6"` - Threat Identification
- **Phase 7**: `phase="7"` - Mitigation Planning
- **Phase 7.5**: `phase="7.5"` - Code Validation Analysis
- **Phase 8**: `phase="8"` - Residual Risk Analysis
- **Phase 9**: `phase="9"` - Output Generation

## ⚠️ Important: Use Focused Guidance

Instead of trying to follow this entire plan at once, call the consolidated
`manage_workflow` guidance action for the phase at hand. It provides focused,
actionable instructions and helps prevent context overload.

## 📊 Progress Tracking

- **Progress Tracking**: `manage_workflow(action="status")` - Check current progress and next steps at any time

## AWS Documentation Integration - MANDATORY REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL**: This threat modeling process REQUIRES the use of the AWS Documentation MCP server for ALL AWS-related analysis. This is not optional - it is a mandatory validation step that must be completed for each phase involving AWS services.

### AWS Documentation Tools - REQUIRED USAGE
1. **`search_documentation`** - MUST be used to search AWS documentation for security best practices
2. **`read_documentation`** - MUST be used to read specific AWS documentation pages
3. **`recommend`** - MUST be used to get content recommendations for AWS documentation pages

### MANDATORY AWS Documentation Usage
- **Architecture Analysis**: MUST validate ALL AWS service security configurations against official AWS documentation
- **Trust Boundary Analysis**: MUST confirm VPC, security group, and network security best practices using AWS docs
- **Asset Flow Analysis**: MUST verify data protection and encryption recommendations through AWS documentation
- **Threat Identification**: MUST research AWS-specific threat vectors and mitigations using AWS docs
- **Mitigation Planning**: MUST validate ALL security control implementations against AWS best practices

### ENFORCED AWS Documentation Usage Pattern
```
FOR EVERY AWS SERVICE OR SECURITY RECOMMENDATION:
1. MANDATORY: Use search_documentation to find relevant AWS security guidance
2. MANDATORY: Use read_documentation to get detailed implementation guidance  
3. MANDATORY: Use recommend to discover related security documentation
4. MANDATORY: Document AWS documentation references in your analysis
5. MANDATORY: Integrate findings into your threat model analysis with citations
```

### AWS Documentation Validation Requirements
**BEFORE proceeding with any AWS-related analysis, you MUST:**
1. Search for current AWS security best practices using `search_documentation`
2. Read at least one official AWS documentation page using `read_documentation`
3. Include AWS documentation URLs and citations in your analysis
4. Validate ALL recommendations against official AWS guidance

**FAILURE TO USE AWS DOCUMENTATION WILL RESULT IN INCOMPLETE THREAT MODELING**

## Phase 1: Business Context Analysis

### Objectives
- Understand the business value and criticality of the system
- Identify regulatory and compliance requirements
- Establish business impact thresholds

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1.1: Review Context Contracts as Needed
**Tool:** `manage_system_context(action="describe", section=SECTION)`
- Use `business`, `software`, `data_assets`, `user_personas`, or `nfrs` to load
  only that section's fields and exact enum values
- Use `section="all"` for the compact action and payload overview

#### Step 1.2: Set Complete System Context
**Tool:** `manage_system_context(action="set", section="all", values=CONTEXT)`
- Submit one nested object with `business` and `software` objects plus
  `data_assets`, `user_personas`, and `nfrs` arrays
- The business object includes the description, all scalar features, and all four
  geographic facets: `data_residency`, `compute_location`, `user_base_location`,
  and `organizational_headquarters`
- Payload shape: `values={"business": BUSINESS_VALUES, "software": SOFTWARE_VALUES, "data_assets": DATA_ASSET_ITEMS, "user_personas": PERSONA_ITEMS, "nfrs": NFR_ITEMS}`

`inspect_data_models(model_name=...)` remains available when an individual enum
needs to be inspected outside the system-context workflow.

#### Step 1.3: Validate Context Completeness
**Tool:** `manage_system_context(action="validate", section="all")`
- Enforce the business-context completion gate
- Report software, data asset, user persona, and NFR coverage
- Resolve every missing business feature before advancing

#### Step 1.4: Document Assumptions
**Tool:** `manage_assumptions(action="add", values=ASSUMPTION)`
- Document key business assumptions that affect the threat model
- Examples:
  - "System will only operate in North America" (limits regulatory scope)
  - "Peak load is 10x normal traffic during sales events" (affects availability requirements)
  - "Customer data retention is 7 years" (affects data lifecycle)

#### Step 1.5: Review Complete System Context
**Tool:** `manage_system_context(action="get", section="all")`
- Review business context and every classification profile
- Ensure all critical business and classification fields are captured

### Expected Outputs
- Complete business context with categorized features
- Documented assumptions about business scope and requirements
- Clear understanding of regulatory and compliance needs

#### Step 7.4: Review Mitigation Coverage and Validate Links
**Tool:** `manage_threats` list/get actions for the `threats` and `mitigations` sections
- **Critical**: Ensure ALL threats have at least one linked mitigation
- **Critical**: Ensure ALL mitigations are linked to at least one threat
- Identify gaps in mitigation coverage using systematic review:

**Validation Process:**
1. **List all threats**: `manage_threats(action="list", section="threats")`
2. **For each threat**: `manage_threats(action="get", section="threats", item_id=ID)`
3. **List all mitigations**: `manage_threats(action="list", section="mitigations")`
4. **For each mitigation**: `manage_threats(action="get", section="mitigations", item_id=ID)`
5. **Identify orphaned threats**: Threats with no mitigations
6. **Identify orphaned mitigations**: Mitigations not linked to any threats
7. **Create additional mitigations**: For unmitigated threats
8. **Link existing mitigations**: To appropriate threats where applicable

**Gap Resolution Examples:**
- If threat T001 has no mitigations: Create and link appropriate mitigations
- If mitigation M001 has no threat links: Link to relevant threats or remove if unnecessary
- Prioritize high-severity threats for mitigation coverage first

#### Step 7.5: Validate Complete Threat-Mitigation Matrix
**Process:** Create a comprehensive validation matrix
- **Matrix Check**: Every threat ID should have at least one mitigation ID
- **Reverse Check**: Every mitigation ID should address at least one threat ID
- **Coverage Analysis**: High-severity threats should have multiple mitigations
- **Effectiveness Review**: Ensure mitigation types match threat categories

**Validation Questions to Answer:**
- Are all STRIDE categories covered by mitigations?
- Do all high-severity threats have preventive AND detective controls?
- Are there any threats marked as "accepted" without proper justification?
- Do all AWS-specific threats have AWS-validated mitigations?

#### Step 7.6: Document Mitigation Assumptions
**Tool:** `manage_assumptions(action="add", values=ASSUMPTION)`
- Document assumptions about mitigation effectiveness
- Include AWS-validated assumptions where applicable
- Examples:
  - "Security team will monitor WAF logs daily" (affects detective control effectiveness)

### Execution Flow:
1. **`manage_workflow(action="guidance", phase="1")`** → Complete Phase 1 → **`manage_workflow(action="guidance", phase="2")`** → etc.
2. **`manage_workflow(action="status")`** - Check progress at any time
3. Use the compact domain managers as guided by each phase

### Phase Transition Checklist:
- ✅ Complete all steps in current phase
- ✅ Verify expected outputs are generated
- ✅ Document any assumptions or decisions
- ✅ Move to next phase guidance tool

### Critical Phases Requiring Extra Attention:
- **Phase 7.5**: Start with `manage_code_validation(action="describe")`, then record implementation evidence for every threat and mitigation, validate coverage, and generate the report
- **Phase 8**: Use `manage_threats(action="assess", section="threats", ...)` to record current residual-risk decisions
- **Phase 9**: Use `export_threat_model()` for final output

### Why Use Focused Phase Guidance?
- **Reliability**: No dependency on unimplemented orchestrator functions
- **Transparency**: Users see exactly what tools to use at each step
- **Flexibility**: Users can adapt the process to their specific needs
- **Maintainability**: Domain managers centralize related operations and payload guidance
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot when users follow explicit steps

## Conclusion

This comprehensive plan provides the full methodology, and
`manage_workflow(action="guidance", phase=PHASE)` provides the focused
instructions needed to execute one phase at a time without loading every phase
into context.
